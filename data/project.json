    "description": "This project examines Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire” (1989) as both a cultural artifact and a historical text. By unpacking the song’s rapid-fire litany of postwar events, figures, and crises, the project explores how Joel condensed four decades of global and American history into a form that is at once a mnemonic device, a pop anthem, and a commentary on generational responsibility.",
