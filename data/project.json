By unpacking the song’s rapid-fire litany of postwar events, figures, and crises, the project explores how Joel condensed four decades of global and American history into a form that is at once a mnemonic device, a pop anthem, and a commentary on generational responsibility.","language":"en","slug":"historicizing-wdstf","creator":"raymondhyser","authors":"","media_player":"avannotate","auto_populate_home_page":true,"additional_users":[],"tags":{"tagGroups":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","color":"#A3A3A3"}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"INTRO"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"CHORUS"}]},"created_at":"2025-09-21T22:37:35.571Z","updated_at":"2025-09-22T03:42:39.637Z","generate_pages_site":true},"annotations":{},"events":{},"eventOrder":[],"pages":{"5fd2fbd3-9b57-4894-a04a-5cba157dd4e8":{"content":[],"created_at":"2025-09-21T22:37:35.594Z","created_by":"raymondhyser","title":"Historicizing We Didn't Start the Fire","updated_at":"2025-09-21T22:37:35.594Z","updated_by":"raymondhyser","autogenerate":{"enabled":true,"type":"home"}}},"pageOrder":["5fd2fbd3-9b57-4894-a04a-5cba157dd4e8"]}
